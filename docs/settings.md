# PhillOS System Settings

PhillOS offers an advanced configuration experience that draws inspiration from Android, macOS, and Windows. The goal is to provide a familiar yet powerful set of controls that work across desktop and mobile form factors while embracing the "Living Glass" aesthetic.

## Design Goals

- **Cross-Platform Familiarity**: A unified layout that feels comfortable to users coming from Android, macOS, or Windows.
- **Granular Control**: Every system component exposes detailed toggles so power users can fine‑tune behavior.
- **Conversational Configuration**: A chat-like interface lets users search and modify settings in natural language.
- **Dedicated Control Panel**: Advanced options live in a desktop-style control panel reminiscent of Windows and macOS System Settings.

## Main Layout

1. **Sidebar Navigation**
   - Categories such as *General*, *Personalization*, *Network & Connectivity*, *Privacy & Security*, *Apps*, and *System*.
   - On smaller screens the sidebar collapses into a slide‑out drawer, mirroring Android.
2. **Content Pane**
   - Each category displays tiles or sub-sections with concise descriptions.
   - The layout adapts fluidly from mobile to desktop, adopting grid or column views where appropriate.
3. **Search & Command Bar**
   - A global search field provides instant filtering and quick links to specific panels.
   - Commands typed in natural language are parsed by the built‑in AI to jump directly to relevant controls.

## Key Settings Categories

### General
- Date & time configuration with automatic internet synchronization.
- Region and language settings.
- Notifications and quick toggles for do‑not‑disturb modes.

### Personalization
- Wallpaper, themes, and accent colors.
- [Cursor customization](cursor_themes.md) and pointer speed.
- Home Dashboard widgets and layout preferences.

### Network & Connectivity
- Wi‑Fi and Ethernet management with detailed connection statistics.
- Bluetooth device pairing and advanced options like visibility timeouts.
- Mobile data and tethering controls when running on phones or tablets.

### Privacy & Security
- Biometric enrollment for the [Lock Screen](lock_screen.md).
- Permission manager showing which apps access sensors or data.
- Encrypted storage options and firewall rules via SecureCore.

### Applications
- Default application selection for web links, media, and documents.
- App permission review and background activity limits.
- Uninstallation and optional data cleanup tools.

### System
- Storage usage overview with per-directory breakdowns.
- Battery and power profiles optimized for desktops or mobile devices.
- Developer settings exposing logging, debugging, and emulator options.

## Dedicated Control Panel

PhillOS includes a desktop-oriented Control Panel similar to macOS System Settings or the Windows Control Panel. It provides

- **Tree-based Navigation** for quickly diving into nested advanced options.
- **History Panel** showing recently changed settings for easy rollback.
- **Backup & Restore** to export or import system configurations.
- **Hardware Diagnostics** with sensor readouts and self-test utilities.

This control panel complements the conversational interface, giving power users a straightforward way to audit and modify low-level parameters.

## Conversational Interface

Typing or speaking commands like *"turn on dark mode"* or *"show Bluetooth devices"* opens the relevant panel and previews the change. The AI suggests related options and can automate multi-step tasks, such as connecting to a Wi‑Fi network or configuring firewall rules.

## Conclusion

The PhillOS settings experience aims to be both welcoming and deeply configurable. By blending familiar patterns from major operating systems with AI-driven convenience, users can effortlessly tailor the environment to their needs across mobile and desktop hardware.
