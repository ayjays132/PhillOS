# PhillOS Blueprint

This document consolidates the core architectural vision for PhillOS. It draws from the detailed blueprint and README to outline the system's goals, boot process, kernel design, and the agent-driven paradigm.

## North-Star Vision

PhillOS proposes an operating system where **AI is the OS itself**. The "Living Glass" design and deep contextual awareness work together to create an ambient, adaptive environment that anticipates user intent and personalizes every interaction. Core principles include:

- **Contextual Awareness** and proactive assistance that adjust to user behavior and environment.
- **Adaptive UI/UX** that responds to device form factor and input method.
- **Personalized Learning** while maintaining a **privacy-first** approach using local AI models by default.

## Boot Pipeline Overview

The project ships with a minimal bootloader and C-based kernel. Building an image involves:

1. Installing cross‑compiler and EFI tooling (`x86_64-elf-gcc`, `gnu-efi`, `grub-mkrescue`, etc.).
2. Running `./scripts/build.sh` to compile the bootloader, kernel, and web interface.
3. Creating an ISO with `make -C bootloader OUT_DIR=../dist/bootloader iso` and flashing it to a USB drive with `dd` or a graphical tool.
4. Booting on UEFI hardware (Secure Boot disabled) or via QEMU.

## Kernel Architecture

PhillOS envisions a single **AI‑native kernel** that integrates machine‑learning models for dynamic resource allocation, intelligent process scheduling, and self‑healing. Memory management and task prioritization adapt to predicted user needs. A responsive UI layer sits above this kernel, scaling across phones, desktops, and other devices.

## Agent Mode

The blueprint describes an orchestration layer of **PhillOS Agents**:

- Agents interpret high‑level intent expressed in natural language.
- They decompose complex tasks, delegate work to applications or micro‑agents, and pass data between them.
- Continuous learning and explainable controls let users review and adjust an agent's plan.

This architecture aims to turn the OS into a proactive digital partner that manages workflows on the user's behalf.
