// This file is no longer actively used by OnboardingStepper.tsx as of the latest changes.
// OnboardingStepper.tsx now handles its own loading/redirect message when onboarding is complete
// and it's programmatically navigating to the home screen.

// Keeping the file for now in case it's reinstated or repurposed,
// but its content can be considered vestigial for the current onboarding flow.

import React from 'react'; // Still need React for JSX type if it were used.

const OnboardingCompleteStepPlaceholder: React.FC = () => {
  return null; // Or a minimal placeholder if it were to be rendered.
};

export default OnboardingCompleteStepPlaceholder;
// Original content has been removed as it's not used in the primary success path of onboarding completion.
